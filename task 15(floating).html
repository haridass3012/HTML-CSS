		<p style="text-align:justify;">	A computer is a digital ectronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations 
					(computation) automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally 
					complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked
					and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens
	     				and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design,as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones.
